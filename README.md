# AngularAkademy_SearchEngine
The purpose of this project was to create a search engine with a mechanism of suggesting values.
The program uses a pool of suggested values in .json file - "./assets/data.json".
After clicking the “search” button, a page with Google search results for the phrase entered in the
text input should open in new browser tab.
